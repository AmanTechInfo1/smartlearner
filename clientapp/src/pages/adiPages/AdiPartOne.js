                  Each clip contains one or more developing hazards, such as
                  vehicles, pedestrians and road conditions. You should respond
                  by clicking the mouse as soon as you see a hazard developing
                  that may result in you, the driver, having to take some
                  action, such as changing speed or direction. The earlier you
                  notice a developing hazard and make a response, the higher
                  your score. However, you must wait until the hazard actually
                  starts to develop and not click too early. Your response won’t
                  cause the scene in the video to change in any way. However, a
                  red flag will appear at the bottom of the screen to show that
                  your response has been noted. Before each clip starts,
                  there’ll be a 10-second pause so that you can see the new road
                  situation. The hazard perception tests lasts about 20 minutes.
                  There are 15 scoreable hazards in total. You can score up to

                  This is because ADIs are expected to have a higher standard of

                  for the multiple choice part of the test is 85% (85% questions

                  above. So, it’s possible for you to get an overall mark of 85%
                  or higher but still fail the test because you haven’ gained
                  the minimum of 80% in one or more of the four bands. For the
                  hazard perception test, the pass mark is 57 out of a possible

                  applying for the test of driving ability if you’re successful.
                  If you fail, you’ll be told which bands contained wrong
