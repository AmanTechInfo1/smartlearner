                  Learning styles are a popular concept in psychology and
                  education and are intended to identify how people learn best.
                  The VARK model of learning styles suggests that there are four
                  main types of learners: visual, auditory, reading/writing, and
                  kinaesthetic.

                <p>
                  The idea that students learn best when teaching methods and
                  school activities match their learning styles, strengths, and
                  preferences grew in popularity in the 1970s and 1980s.
                  However, most evidence suggests that personal learning
                  preferences have little to no actual influence on learning
                  outcomes.

                  The 3rd level, goals, and context of driving, deal with
                  driver’s decisions relating to the purpose of their journey,
                  the influence of passengers, and the time the drive takes
                  place. The decisions taken by drivers at this level can have a
                  serious impact on driver risk.

                  While the existing research has found that matching teaching
                  methods to learning styles has no influence on educational
                  outcomes, the concept of learning styles remains extremely
                  popular.

                  There are two elements to this and both must be addressed in
                  the “Recap at the start” at the test centre. You should have
                  agreed with the pupil at the end of the previous lesson what
                  the lesson goals* would be next time. They should be confirmed
                  again with the pupil on the drive to the test centre, on
                  Standards Check day. The examiner is then briefed on these
                  goals by you prior to the lesson starting.

                  In the “Recap at the Start”, you should confirm through Q&A
                  what the pupil’s goals are, to see if they have changed
                  (hopefully not!). You should be asking the pupil what they
                  want to practice and why. Actively listening and acting on any
                  concerns is important as is taking note of body language which
                  may betray pupil nerves or anxiety. Questions to check
                  theoretical knowledge of the topic(s) prior to driving away,
                  are recommended.

                  The lesson structure should have been provisionally agreed

                  reflect agreed goals and pupil progress, ideally from simple,
                  to more complex situations, in line with the pupil’s ability

                  Practicing in an area or on a route that the pupil can cope
                  with in order to achieve learning goals, is vital. A safe
                  learning environment in which the pupil might be stretched to
                  the edge of their comfort is preferable. However, pupils might
                  perceive instructor anxiety, may try too hard, or feel
                  stressed because an examiner is present.

                  Be ready if the pupil acts differently from normal or

                  more support and instruction which might require them to move
                  to an area with fewer hazards and risks. Be flexible within

                  coping.

                  • The pupil is committing basic errors which require
                  correction and they are undermining the original goals that
                  were agreed upon.

                  A typical scenario might develop when, for instance, the goals
                  involve improving the pupil’s ability to roundabouts. On the
                  drive to the first roundabout, the pupil stalls the car twice
                  and struggles emerging at T junctions. The instructor should,
                  in agreement with the pupil, correct these driver errors
                  before attempting roundabouts. If confidence and ability are
                  restored and if time allows, a return to the original lesson
                  goals would be logical.
