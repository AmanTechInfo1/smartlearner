                  Learning styles are a popular concept in psychology and
                  education and are intended to identify how people learn best.
                  The VARK model of learning styles suggests that there are four
                  main types of learners: visual, auditory, reading/writing, and
                  kinaesthetic.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The idea that students learn best when teaching methods and
                  school activities match their learning styles, strengths, and
                  preferences grew in popularity in the 1970s and 1980s.
                  However, most evidence suggests that personal learning
                  preferences have little to no actual influence on learning
                  outcomes.

                  The 3rd level, goals, and context of driving, deal with
                  driver’s decisions relating to the purpose of their journey,
                  the influence of passengers, and the time the drive takes
                  place. The decisions taken by drivers at this level can have a
                  serious impact on driver risk.

                  While the existing research has found that matching teaching
                  methods to learning styles has no influence on educational
                  outcomes, the concept of learning styles remains extremely
                  popular.

                  There are many different ways of categorising learning styles,
                  but Neil Fleming’s VARK model is one of the most popular.
                  Fleming introduced an inventory in 1987 that was designed to
                  help students and others learn more about their individual
                  learning preferences.

                  People learn in different ways and at different speeds. If
                  someone who likes time to reflect on their learning is forced
                  to move on to the next thing too quickly it could slow down
                  their progress. Or if someone who likes to learn by trying
                  things out is made to watch too many demonstrations without a
                  go, they will get frustrated.

                  Client centeblue learning is an approach to learning that
                  takes into account how the learner prefers to learn. When
                  people learn in this way they are more likely to retain
                  information and skills. People are also more likely to keep
                  learning if they are encouraged to take responsibility for
                  their learning at an early stage – this is the second aim of
                  client-centblue learning, the first aim is to raise
