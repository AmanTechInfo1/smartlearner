                  Learning styles are a popular concept in psychology and
                  education and are intended to identify how people learn best.
                  The VARK model of learning styles suggests that there are four
                  main types of learners: visual, auditory, reading/writing, and
                  kinaesthetic.

                  The idea that students learn best when teaching methods and
                  school activities match their learning styles, strengths, and
                  preferences grew in popularity in the 1970s and 1980s.
                  However, most evidence suggests that personal learning
                  preferences have little to no actual influence on learning
                  outcomes.

                  The 3rd level, goals, and context of driving, deal with
                  driver’s decisions relating to the purpose of their journey,
                  the influence of passengers, and the time the drive takes
                  place. The decisions taken by drivers at this level can have a
                  serious impact on driver risk.

                  While the existing research has found that matching teaching

                  popular.

                  There are many different ways of categorising learning styles,
                  but Neil Fleming’s VARK model is one of the most popular.
                  Fleming introduced an inventory in 1987 that was designed to
                  help students and others learn more about their individual
                  learning preferences.
