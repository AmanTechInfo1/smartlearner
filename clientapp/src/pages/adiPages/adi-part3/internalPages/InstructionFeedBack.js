                  There has been much debate about driving instructors having to
                  become coaches, otherwise, they will fail their standards
                  check, this is not the case! What is important is that
                  instructors should be helping their pupils in an active way,
                  placing their pupils at the center of proceedings.{" "}

                  This client-centered approach has proven to be more beneficial
                  in helping pupils take responsibility for their learning and
                  help them become more self-aware. Knowing how thoughts and

                  They may even appear to be disinterested and would probably

                  Another example might be a pupil who hasn’t grasped why
                  cutting a corner is rarely acceptable when suddenly another

                  In this criterion, we evaluate feedback as one of the four
                  cornerstones of coaching for driver development. Feedback is a
                  critical part of the learning process. It should not be
                  restricted to instruc tors giving their opinions of how the

                  Obtaining feedback from the pupil, known as eliciting
                  feedback, allows ADI to gauge how the pupil perceives their
                  own actions and overall development.

                  Learner drivers like to know how they are doing from time to
                  time and will invariably value their learner’s opinions. When
                  giving feedback, instructors must be positive, honest and link
                  comments to goals for the lesson whenever appropriate.

                <p>
                  Sometimes the feedback will be given as a response to a
                  pupil’s need to know how they are performing. At other times
                  it should be freely offered as a comment on an improvement

                  Good examples of feedback would include, “your mirror checks
                  were well-timed at the roundabout” or “that was good clutch
                  control as we moved away”. Both these examples are short, to
                  the point, make sense and help the pupil feel encouraged to

                  Gaining feedback from the pupil, about what they did and why,
                  allows an assessment of the pupil’s thought processes. Using a
                  scale of 1-10, where 1 is poor and 10 is excellent, for a
                  pupil to rate their achievement allows the ADI to check the
                  pupil’s perception of their own performance.

                  Clearly stating what the feedback refers to is important.
                  Using phrases like, “that was good”, “well done” or “much
                  better that time” is vague and can be easily misunderstood.
                  Good feedback leaves the pupil in no doubt as to exactly what
