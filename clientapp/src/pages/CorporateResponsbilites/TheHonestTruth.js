              Each year, over 825,000 people in the UK pass their driving test,
              gaining independence. However, young drivers(17-24) are the
              highest risk group and road crashes are their leading cause of
              death.

              </a>
              <p>
                Music, mobiles, laughing and joking. All signs of a good time,
                but in a car these things all increase the risk of a collision.
                Inattention is the most common reason for car crashes and one of
                the biggest problems facing you as a new driver is carrying
                friends in your car.

              </a>
              <p>
                1 in five 5 deaths involve alcohol. Young men aged 16-24 are
                more likely to die from an alcohol related road traffic
                collision and are the cause of over 400 deaths each year.

              </a>
              <p>
                Research by Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) found that 17%
                of drivers who die in road crashes (more than one in six) have
                traces of illegal drugs in their system, which may have affected
                their driving.

              </a>
              <p>
                Insurance can be expensive and the biggest factors that
                influence your premium are age and where you live. Of course
                these are things you can't really alter, but these are not the
                only factors that influence your premium. Using popular price
                comparison websites, you can easily save up to 35% of the cost
                of your insurance.

              </a>
              <p>
                A good driver is completely focused on the road. Always. Using a
                hand-held or hands-free mobile phone while driving is a
                distraction and increases the risk of a driver crashing.

                <h3>6. Seatbelts</h3>
              </a>
              <p>
                In a crash, someone not wearing a seatbelt is twice as likely to
                die as someone who is using one. Research indicates that
                approximately one-third of those killed in collisions weren’t
                wearing a seatbelt. If you think you don’t need to wear a
                seatbelt because your car has airbags, think again. The proper
                term for an airbag is a Supplementary Restraint System (SRS) -
                supplementary meaning ‘in addition to’. That means in addition
                to the seatbelt!

                Fancy a £150 fine and a long walk home? The police have the

              </a>
              <p>
                Excessive speed contributes to 12% of all injury-causing
                crashes, 18% of crashes resulting in a serious injury and 28% of
                all fatal crashes. That means around 500 people are killed each
                year on Britain's roads because drivers and riders travel too
                fast.

              <p>
                Young drivers are statistically more likely to crash because
                they are twice as likely to undertake a journey whilst feeling
                tired. One in four young drivers admit to continuing to drive
                while experiencing signs of fatigue, compared with one in eight
                of the rest of the population.

              <p>
                Almost everyone walks and most people, at some time, ride a
                bicycle. And yet, around 45,000 cyclists and pedestrians are
                killed or injured on Britain’s roads every year. The driver was
                found to be at fault in most collisions involving a cyclist and
                a car. Cyclists are 30 times more likely to be seriously injured
                in a collision than a car occupant.
