                <hr />
                <p>
                  The first step is making sure your eligible to become an
                  instructor. To become an instructor you must be over 21 and
                  have held a full driving license for 3+ years. You will be
                  required to have a Criminal Record Check (CRB). There are 3
                  parts/exams you must pass before you become a fully qualified
                  driving instructor. However, before you apply for these tests
                  we will need to apply and receive your unique PRN number.

                <h3>Step 2 - ADI Theory Test</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  Part 1 of ADI training is all about ensuring you have a
                  thorough knowledge of the highway code and hazard perception.
                  The test consists of 100 multiple choice questions with you
                  needing to achieve a score of 85+ to pass. You will also need
                  to pass the Hazard Perception test by achieving a score of 57
                  out of 75. <br />
                  Note: You have unlimited attempts, however, each test you need
                  to take will cost £81.00

                <h3>Step 3 - Driving Ability Test</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  Part 2 of the ADI training focuses on your driving ability,
                  similar to the original test you would have sat to get your
                  full driving license. To ensure you’re prepared, if you train
                  with us, we provide 10 hours of lessons with an ORDIT Approved
                  Trainer.
                  <br /> Note: You have a maximum of 3 attempts. Each test
                  attempt costs £111.00

                <h3>Step 4 - Learn And Earn</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>
                  After passing your driving ability test, you are required to
                  take 40 hours of training with a qualified trainer. This
                  allows you to apply for a “pink badge” which means you to
                  provisionally teach learners and earn for 6 months. If you
                  decided to go down the “pink badge” route you will be able to
                  take a pupil you are currently teaching. This route requires
                  you to pay for 20 hours of additional training, however, this
                  cost is easily covered by the money you will be earning from
                  lessons.

                <hr />
                <p>
                  Alternatively, once you complete your 40 hours of training you
                  can apply to take your final test (also known as part 3.) This
                  exam is all about your ability to teach a pupils. If you
                  decide to go straight for the exam you would be required to
                  find a full license holder who owns their own car. Note: You
                  have a maximum of 3 attempts. Each test will cost £111.00
