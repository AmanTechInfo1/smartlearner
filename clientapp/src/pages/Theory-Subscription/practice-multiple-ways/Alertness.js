                    The first topic from the theory test is alertness. This
                    refers to how alert a driver is whilst behind the wheel. The
                    road can be an unpredictable place, so it’s important that a
                    driver does not get distracted by things such as: mobile
                    phones and music, is prepared for any potential hazard, and,
                    follows road signs and markings correctly.

                  <p>
                    Adjusting the radio is one of the most common forms of
                    distracted driving. At any given time, more than 600,000
                    drivers are manipulating electronic devices, like radios,
                    while driving, according to The National Highway Traffic
                    Safety Administration.

                    Vehicle navigation systems can be useful when driving on
                    unfamiliar routes. However, they can also distract you and
                    cause you to lose control if you try to adjust them while
                    driving. Park up in a convenient and safe place before
                    adjusting them.

                  <h3>Mobile</h3>

                  <p>
                    TUsing mobile phones can cause drivers to take their eyes
                    off the road, their hands off the steering wheel, and their
                    minds off the road and the surrounding situation. Studies
                    suggest that drivers using a mobile phone are approximately
                    four times more likely to be involved in a crash than a
                    driver who does not use a phone while driving.

                    If you’re on the road for a long period of time, you’ll need
                    to take precautions to avoid feeling sleepy—any lapse in
                    judgement could be catastrophic. This means either winding
                    your window down to let in a fresh supply of air or taking a
                    breather at the next available rest stop. If you’re taking a
                    road trip or any long journey, plan your route and implement
                    frequent rest stops to make sure you don’t get too fatigued.
                    It is usually recommended you take at least a 15 minute
                    break after every 2 hours of driving.

                    It’s also your responsibility to avoid things that can
                    affect your concentration and reaction time on the road,
                    such as alcohol and drugs. You should also be aware that
                    some medication can negatively affect your ability to
                    control your vehicle, so always read the label and speak to
                    your doctor beforehand.

                    You need to be alert to what’s going on around you at all
                    times. This means that you need to check your car mirrors
                    regularly- it is recommended you glance at your mirrors
                    every 6 seconds to keep yourself up-to-date with your
                    surroundings and the traffic. You also need to be aware of
                    any potential blind spots, e.g. the area near the windscreen
                    pillar. Before you proceed with any manoeuvre, you need to
                    use the Mirrors, Signal, and Manoeuvre (MSM) routine.

                    slowly until you can see properly. Similarly, if you’re
                    attempting a manoeuvre but haven’t got a full view of the
                    area around you, ask someone to guide you.

                    Road signs and markings are there for a reason. If you’ve
                    spotted a give way sign, or a warning about changes to the
                    speed limit, you should prepare by slowing down. Don’t leave
                    things to the last second. It’s the same as when you’re
                    approaching a set of traffic lights—if they’ve been on green
                    for some time, you know that they’re likely to switch to
                    red, which means you need to slow down immediately.

                    and that is legal to do so. Therefore, you will want to
