              SmartLearner was founded in 2004 with the vision of becoming the
              best driving school in Coventry. Now in 2021, we have far
              surpassed our original goals. We are the highest-rated driving
              school in Warwickshire and the West Midlands. SmartLearner was
              even voted the ‘Regional Driving School Of The Year’ at the
              Intelligent Instructor Awards 2021 and 2022!
            </p>
            <p>
              Our learners regularly achieve a higher-than-average pass rate
              with a below-average number of lessons. This is because we have
              over 50 instructors all based locally who are trained to the
              highest standard! Our driving instructors teach in both Manual and
              Automatic. We have an amazing team of friendly and enthusiastic
              local Male and Female instructors. SmartLearner also doesn’t shy
              away from the use of modern technology to enhance our pupils
              driving experience.

              learning styles. We offer our pupils so much more than just
