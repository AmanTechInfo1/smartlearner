        <h2>Our Planet. Our Corporate Social Responsibility.</h2>
        <p>
          Lockdown due to coronavirus (COVID-19) was a hard time for the world,
          however, it has itâ€™s benefits. One of the major positive impacts COVID
          had was on our environment. There us no doubt that carbon emissions
          have sharply fallen in the recent year and this has had a instant
          affect on our planet. Clear water in the Venice canals, blue skies
          over Delhi and wild animals are roaming in locked-down cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the reality is that these changes are short-lived and we will
          likely see a rocketing rebound in carbon emissions. That is unless we
          take action to secure a greener and more sustainable future.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a driving school, we are one of the biggest contributors to the
          release of CO2 and therefore must take action to negate our impact on
          our planet. We aim to become more environmentally sustainable and
          establish green goals for our future. We are already actively taking
          steps to secure a green future for our City and our planet.
